# LiveProjectCodeSummary

<h2>Introduction and SignIn</h2>

For my final course in my time at The Tech Academy, I participated in a C# Live Project, coordinating with other students and instructors. We worked with Visual Studio on front-end and back-end improvements, and used Azure boards for project management. Daily stand-ups and emails modeled a typical work environment over the course of a two week sprint, with weekly code retrospectives. Working within a student built website, the project was based on a theatre that requested help with functionality and interfaces for user operation. The first part included adding our names to a sign in file on the website, to demonstrate understanding regarding creating and merging branches using Visual Studio.

<h2>Reserve Story</h2>

After the initial SignIn portion, we were assigned a smaller story to acclimate ourselves to the feel of how the boards and work items in Azure functioned. My reserve story was to create the site’s homepage, matching the page to the client’s requested standards. Working on the front-end side, my objectives were to code the page and set the css for the page within the primary site css file.
RentalHistory entity models and CRUD

<h2>Rental History</h2>

After the reserve story, I was assigned to the rental history portion of the site, asked with creating pages which documented all rentals that were issued, including damage and a brief summary of the damage, if any. I first needed to create entity models for the rental history, using a code first approach. After creating the model, the controller and views were created for Create, Edit, Details, Delete, and Index CRUD pages.

<h2> Styling the Create/Edit pages </h2>
For the styling of the pages, I wrote code in the css and JavaScript files of the rental area. Built a javascript function that changed the form labels if the rental was damaged or not. If damaged, the label for "Notes" would change to "Damages Incurred".

<h2>Skills Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Using proper version control. Creating new branches from the master, which would be updated daily, and learning how to save changes. Committing and pushing branches and creating pull requests when merging branches to the master.</li>
    <li>Working as a team on a project. Using resources together to solve problems, such as the Discord app for communication, and daily Stand ups with the project manager.</li>
    <li>Using Azure DevOps to maintain work items and boards.
    Basic understanding of how a development teams work and operate through a sprint. Sprint planning, stand ups, code retrospectives. Overall planning that goes into a project and how its broken down for ease and function.</li>
    <li>Improved knowledge of MVC and CRUD.</li>
